Offers Module Implementation
=============================
One Acre Fund has been using the Odoo Point of Sale (PoS) module to perform sales in shops. The product manager for your team has requested that you add a module that allows for creation and configuration of offers. An offer is defined as a grouping of one or more products that are sold at a promotional price for a limited time.

Features include:
- Create an offer 
- Configure the offer to contain one or more products
- Set a price for the offer
- Set a date range that the offer is valid
- The Point of Sale module should display valid offers with their associated prices and allow them to be ordered (BONUS: The receipt shows not only the offer name, but also the list of products included in the offer).
